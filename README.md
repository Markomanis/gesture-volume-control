Gesture Volume Control Software
Explore this captivating project that leverages an array of technologies, including Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, Osascript, and Pycaw. The focal point of this project is a unique gesture-based volume control software. Using your webcam input, this software detects and tracks your hand movements, enabling you to control your computer's volume with just two fingers. The project utilizes OpenCV's Python module to capture video frames from the webcam, while Mediapipe provides pre-trained machine learning models to detect hands in real-time. By identifying key points on the hand, gestures are recognized, allowing for volume control based on the distance between two fingertips. Osascript is employed for Mac systems, while Pycaw serves as the volume control mechanism for Windows.
